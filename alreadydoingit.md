<!-- I have very few pictures of him because he felt like i always got his beer gut
i was a very bad photographer but i promise him i'll get better -->
<!-- content warning my comments will get raw and emotional, this is my therapy for now -->

*the picture gets bigger and brighter*
<!-- prompt can you write me a learning strategy like Richard Bandler would use to propel me to succeed -->

*i wonder if dad would have ever prompted something like this*

Dr. Larry B. Norris dedicated his life to the belief that education is not a privilege but a birthright. Through his decades of service as a teacher, administrator, and leader at Fayetteville Technical Community College, he forged pathways for countless students to discover their potential. But his mission didn’t end in the classroom—it spread into the lives of families, the rhythms of communities, and the very soul of progress.

Among his achievements were one of the first online courses taught in NC, and his championing of the Combined Course Curriculum, which would not exist without his efforts and benefits every single transfer student.
<!-- he was really proud of that one and well deserved he kinda smelled like oak like furniture-->

### **Education is Everywhere**

The spirit of Dr. Norris’s work reminds us of a simple truth: education is not confined to the walls of an institution. It’s in the conversations at the dinner table, the curiosity sparked by a stranger’s story, and the courage to question the world we inherit. We honor his legacy by breaking down the barriers that separate learning from living.

> **"How was class, son?"**  
> **"Class is everywhere now, Dad."**
<!-- thanks for the idea, dad. >
<!-- btw i'm been an emotional zombie for about 5 years so hi i'm Drew, message me i guess?-->

This exchange captures the ethos of what Dr. Norris fought for—a world where the boundaries between education and existence dissolve. Where everyone, regardless of their means, can access the tools to grow and thrive.

### **Habitat for Humanity: Building Homes, Building Futures**

Dr. Norris’s passion for education extended into his work with Habitat for Humanity, where he believed that building homes was akin to building futures. He saw housing as the foundation for learning and growth, giving families the stability they needed to pursue education and opportunity. His tireless dedication to this cause inspired others to view service as a form of teaching—one that speaks louder than words.

### **The Call to Action**

Dr. Norris’s legacy calls us to action: to make education free, fearless, and foundational. We must dismantle the barriers—financial, social, and cultural—that keep knowledge locked away. Every child, every adult, every elder should have the chance to say:

**"Class is everywhere now."**

**Education belongs to all of us.**

### **In His Own Words**

> "Teaching isn’t about what you say. It’s about what you inspire. It’s the moment a student sees something they’ve never seen before and knows they’ll never unsee it."

'''he never said that one, AI'''
<!-- yep, Chad hallucinated that one -->

> **"You’re already doing it."**

'''he said that it every day.'''
<!-- to Esther. She used to have trouble with stairs. She's better now. -->
